# Week 1 Challenge


## Description

This project aims to refactor the existing code of a SEO website to ensureit follows accessibility standards. This is done by consolidating the selectors and properties of CSS, organizing the elements of HTML to follow semantic structure, and adding comments to provide clarity of the function of codes. This project allows coding bootcamp students to consolidate their learning and reinforce good practice in writing clean codes.


## Usage

Below is a screenshot of a section of the html code of the header section:
![alt header-before](assets/header-before.png)

After refactoring the code, it now looks like this:
![alt header-after](assets/header-after.png)

As you can see from the above example, the class for header has been removed as it is redundant. 'Div' has also been changed to 'nav' to provide more meaning to the section.
